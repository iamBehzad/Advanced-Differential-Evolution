# Advanced-Differential-Evolution
A metaheuristic algorithm, called Advanced Differential Evolution (ADE) by improving the DE algorithm.

This repositorie proposes a metaheuristic algorithm, called Advanced Differential Evolution (ADE) by improving the DE algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses chaos theory to generate the initial population, which is then divided into two sub-population with adaptive sizes. The size of each sub-population is determined using a formula during the algorithm's execution with respect to numbers of iterations. The first sub-population has a larger size in the beginning and the second one has a smaller size, but the total size of these two populations is always constant. The main contribution of this paper is to propose two novel improved differential evolution algorithms, namely MDE1 And MDE2, used to explore within these groups. The proposed ADE is tested on 29 well-known benchmarks and three engineering studies, and the results are compared with six other algorithms. Various statistical experiments are carried out showing that the proposed algorithm provides significant superiority over other well-known algorithms.
